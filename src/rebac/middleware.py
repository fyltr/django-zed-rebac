class ActorMiddleware:
    """Reads `request.user` (via the configured resolver) and sets the
    `current_actor()` ContextVar for the duration of the request.

    Add to MIDDLEWARE *after* `AuthenticationMiddleware`.

    Superuser bypass: when ``REBAC_SUPERUSER_BYPASS`` and
    ``REBAC_ALLOW_SUDO`` are both True (the defaults) and the request
    user is an active superuser, the request runs inside a
    ``sudo(reason="superuser-bypass")`` bracket. This mirrors the
    bypass that ``rebac.backends.auth.RebacBackend.has_perm`` already
    applies to ``user.has_perm(perm, obj)`` checks, but at the
    QuerySet layer:
    ``Model.objects.with_actor(superuser).filter(...)`` returns every
    row instead of ``accessible()``-scoped, matching the legacy
    contrib.auth contract that admin sees everything.

    Routing through the public ``sudo()`` context manager means each
    superuser request emits a ``KIND_SUDO_BYPASS`` audit row — that's
    the auditability cost of the elevated scope. Tenants that want to
    suppress the bypass (and therefore the audit volume) flip
    ``REBAC_SUPERUSER_BYPASS = False``; tenants that disable sudo
    globally (``REBAC_ALLOW_SUDO = False``) get neither bypass nor
    audit row, which is the right fail-closed behaviour.
