"""Zookie freshness ContextVar + per-call consistency resolution.

Proposal 0002. The mechanism that closes SpiceDB's write-then-read
staleness window: every write returns a ``Zookie``; subsequent reads
within the same scope auto-upgrade to ``at_least_as_fresh(<zookie>)``
under default consistency.

LocalBackend's freshness witness is the existing
``Relationship.written_at_xid`` column (already populated on every
write); ``Zookie.token`` carries the xid and the backend translates
``at_least_as_fresh`` to a ``written_at_xid <= cutoff`` filter.

Transport between calls within a single request: the
``_current_zookie`` ContextVar, set automatically by
``write_relationships`` / ``delete_relationships``, read automatically
by ``effective_consistency``. Cross-request transport for SPAs / JWT
clients is opt-in via ``REBAC_ZOOKIE_TRANSPORT`` — see ``middleware.py``
for the header path.

Backend kind guard: Zookies are NOT portable across backends. A token
emitted by ``SpiceDBBackend`` (``kind="spicedb"``) handed to
``LocalBackend`` would be interpreted as a numeric xid — almost
certainly with garbage semantics. The backends validate
``zookie.backend`` matches ``self.kind`` and raise on mismatch.
