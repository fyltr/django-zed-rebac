"""Strawberry + Channels integration for ``django-zed-rebac``.

Proposal 0002. Two pieces:

  - :class:`RebacExtension` — Strawberry Schema Extension that brackets
    every GraphQL operation (query, mutation, AND each subscription
    emission) with a fresh :func:`rebac.evaluator.evaluator_scope` +
    :func:`rebac.consistency.zookie_scope`. This is the GraphQL-side
    equivalent of what :class:`rebac.middleware.ActorMiddleware` does
    for plain HTTP.

  - :class:`RebacChannelsConsumerMixin` — mixin for Channels
    consumers carrying GraphQL-over-WebSocket subscriptions. Resolves
    the actor at handshake from ``self.scope["user"]`` and pins it on
    the connection-level :func:`rebac.actors._current_actor`. The
    actor lives for the connection lifetime; the evaluator + Zookie
    scopes inside :class:`RebacExtension` reset per emission so a
    revoked grant takes effect on the next yield.

Subscription invariants (per proposal 0002 § "Subscription lifecycle"):

  - **Actor**: connection-scoped. A long-lived WS started 2h ago
    keeps the actor identity it had at handshake. (Auth re-validation
    is a separate concern from this adapter.)
  - **Evaluator**: per-emission. Revoked grants take effect at the
    next tick, never silently served from a connection-wide cache.
  - **Zookie**: per-emission. Subscriptions are inherently
    write-triggered (the data changed, that's why we emit), so the
    write's Zookie naturally lives within the per-emission scope.

Behind the ``[strawberry]`` extra:

    pip install django-zed-rebac[strawberry]

Importing this module without the extra installed raises a
``ModuleNotFoundError`` with a hint. We don't import
``strawberry.channels`` here — Channels is wired by the consumer's
own ASGI router and the mixin uses only the public ``scope`` /
``connect`` surface.

    For each GraphQL operation (HTTP query/mutation OR subscription
    emission) the extension:

    1. Opens a fresh evaluator scope (LRU cache per
       ``REBAC_EVALUATOR_CACHE_SIZE``).
    2. Opens a fresh Zookie scope (no initial token — the SchemaExtension
       runs inside whatever transport scope the surrounding
       middleware/consumer already established).
    3. Mirrors ``current_evaluator()`` onto ``info.context.rebac_evaluator``
       and ``current_zookie()`` onto ``info.context.rebac_zookie`` for
       resolvers that prefer explicit DI over the ambient ContextVar.
       Best-effort — if ``info.context`` doesn't accept attribute
       assignment (e.g. a Mapping), the mirror is silently skipped.

    Composition with :class:`rebac.middleware.ActorMiddleware`: for
    plain HTTP GraphQL the middleware already opens evaluator + zookie
    scopes for the request lifetime, and the extension's per-operation
    scopes nest harmlessly inside. The middleware's scopes still apply
    to non-GraphQL response paths (e.g. extension errors before any
    resolver runs).

    Resolves the actor at handshake from ``self.scope["user"]`` and
    pins it on the connection-level :func:`rebac.actors._current_actor`
    ContextVar so every subscription emission sees the same identity.

    Compose with whichever consumer base your stack uses
    (``JsonWebsocketConsumer``, ``AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer``,
    Strawberry's own ``GraphQLWSConsumer`` /
    ``GraphQLTransportWSConsumer``)::

    The mixin overrides ``connect`` only; subscribe / send / disconnect
    flow through the underlying consumer unchanged. ``super().connect()``
    is called so other mixins / the base consumer still run.

    For sync consumers, the mixin's ``connect`` is async because
    Channels' WS protocol is async-only — sync ``JsonWebsocketConsumer``
    spawns a thread-local event loop internally and either ``connect``
    shape works.

    The actor is also re-resolved on each subscription emission by the
    :class:`RebacExtension` schema extension; this mixin's contribution
    is the connection-lifetime ``_current_actor`` so the evaluator and
    Zookie scopes opened per emission have an actor to work with.
