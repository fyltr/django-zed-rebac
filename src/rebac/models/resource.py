"""RebacResource — registry-mode resource table.

A row per ``(resource_type, resource_id)`` pair seen by the engine;
``RelationshipRegistry`` integer FKs point at it. The two correctness
wins are:

  - **Cascade delete**: ``post_delete`` on a ``RebacMixin``-bearing Django
    row removes its ``RebacResource``; CASCADE on ``RelationshipRegistry``
    FKs then sweeps every tuple it appeared in.
  - **Referential integrity**: writes to ``RelationshipRegistry`` can only
    reference a registered ``(type, id)`` pair, surfacing typos as
    constraint violations instead of orphan tuples.

The model is wire-compatible with the public ``RelationshipTuple`` and the
denormalized ``Relationship`` row via the registry's translating manager —
callers writing string kwargs see no shape change.
