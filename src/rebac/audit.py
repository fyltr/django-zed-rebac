"""Single emission point for `PermissionAuditEvent` rows.

`emit()` is the sync public entry; `aemit()` is the async coroutine
sibling. Hooks in `actors.py`, `relationships.py`, and `signals.py`
call them; downstream consumers can call them too — re-exported as
`rebac.emit_audit_event` / `rebac.aemit_audit_event`.

`defer_to_commit=True` (default) routes the write through
`transaction.on_commit`, so audit rows for grant / revoke flows persist
exactly when the surrounding business transaction does. `defer_to_commit=False`
writes immediately — correct for events that must persist regardless of
outer transaction state (sudo enter, permission denial about to roll back).

Sync vs async paths
-------------------

- :func:`emit` — sync entry. The immediate-write path runs the ORM
  ``create()`` directly. If a caller reaches it from inside a running
  event loop (a stray ``sudo()`` from async code, third-party callers
  not yet on the async API, etc.) the write is hopped to a short-lived
  worker thread via :func:`_write_now` so Django's
  ``SynchronousOnlyOperation`` guard doesn't fire. That fallback is
  belt-and-braces — the right answer is to call :func:`aemit` from
  async code.
- :func:`aemit` — async entry. The immediate-write path uses
  ``Model.objects.acreate``; the deferred path registers a sync
  on-commit callback (Django's ``transaction.on_commit`` doesn't
  accept coroutines, and at commit time the surrounding code is
  expected to be sync anyway — the deferred row is written when the
  business transaction commits, which is the right semantics for the
  ``defer_to_commit=True`` case).
