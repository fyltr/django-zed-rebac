"""Role-as-namespace helpers — the GCP-style role-grant convention.

This module is a **convention layer** on top of :mod:`rebac.relationships`.
It does not introduce a new storage type, change the engine, or add
schema syntax. It packages the "role-as-resource" pattern — a standard
SpiceDB recipe — into ergonomic helpers so every consumer doesn't
hand-roll the same four CRUD wrappers around :class:`Relationship`.

The convention
==============

Predefined roles per package / addon live as objects in a
``<namespace>/role`` resource type, where:

- ``namespace`` is the package or addon name (``storage``, ``knowledge``,
  ``agents``, …).
- ``object_id`` is the role name (``object_viewer``, ``object_admin``,
  ``vault_editor``, …).
- The single relation used for membership is ``member`` (constant
  :data:`ROLE_RELATION`).

Schema
------

Every addon ships a single ``definition <namespace>/role`` block in its
``rebac.zed``::

    definition storage/role {
        relation member: auth/user | auth/group#member
    }

Resources reference role memberships via the ``#member`` subject-set::

    definition storage/file {
        relation viewer: auth/user
                       | auth/group#member
                       | storage/role:object_viewer#member
                       | storage/role:object_admin#member

        permission read = viewer
    }

Granting Alice the ``object_viewer`` role is one row::

    >>> from rebac.roles import grant
    >>> grant(actor=alice, role="storage/role:object_viewer")

…and every ``storage/file`` then evaluates ``read`` against the new
grant. No per-file Relationship rows needed.

Role hierarchy
==============

Two stock-SpiceDB recipes, both supported without extra machinery:

**Permission composition** (per-resource) — wider roles appear in the
narrower role's permission expression::

    permission read   = viewer + editor + admin
    permission write  = editor + admin
    permission delete = admin

**Relation traversal** (per-role) — wider roles are members of the
narrower role via the ``#member`` subject-set::

    definition storage/role {
        relation member: auth/user
                       | auth/group#member
                       | storage/role:object_admin#member   // admin includes viewer
    }

Pick one style per addon. Composition is more explicit; traversal is
DRYer for deep hierarchies.

System / framework roles
========================

Bypass paths for framework jobs (migrations, asset seed loaders) use
:func:`rebac.actors.sudo` — they are not modelled as roles. The role
helpers here are exclusively for **actor-grantable** roles (the GCP
``roles/<service>.<role>`` shape).

"""The relation used by :func:`imply` to wire one role's effective members

        relation includes: <namespace>/role#effective_member

    }

…and resources reference ``<namespace>/role:<name>#effective_member``
instead of ``#member``. :func:`imply` then writes the ``includes`` tuple
that wires one role's effective_member into another's.

Addons that don't need runtime-editable hierarchy can skip the
``includes`` relation entirely and use per-resource permission composition
(``permission read = viewer + editor + admin``) instead.
