## What you author

A **schema** is a `.zed` file shipped alongside your Django app. It declares the resource types, relations, permissions, and caveats your app uses. The plugin parses every app's `.zed` file at sync time and stores the result in `Schema*` tables; both backends (`LocalBackend`, `SpiceDBBackend`) consume the same parsed output.

You write three things and only three things:

1. **A `.zed` file** — `<app>/permissions.zed`, in SpiceDB's schema language.
2. **A pointer on the AppConfig** — `rebac_schema = "permissions.zed"`.
3. **A type label on each model** — `class Meta: rebac_resource_type = "<app>/<type>"`.

That's it. No Python schema-builder, no `Meta.permission_relations`, no decorators on the schema itself. The `.zed` file is the source of truth — same syntax SpiceDB users already know.

---

## The minimum viable schema

```zed
// blog/permissions.zed
// @rebac_package: blog
// @rebac_package_version: 0.1.0
// @rebac_schema_revision: 1

definition blog/post {
    relation owner: auth/user

    permission read  = owner
    permission write = owner
}
```

```python
# blog/apps.py
from django.apps import AppConfig

class BlogConfig(AppConfig):
    name = "blog"
    rebac_schema = "permissions.zed"   # relative to the app's package dir
```

```python
# blog/models.py
from django.db import models
from rebac import RebacMixin

class Post(RebacMixin, models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    class Meta:
        rebac_resource_type = "blog/post"
```

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py rebac sync       # parses permissions.zed → Schema* tables
```

`Post.objects.with_actor(request.user).all()` now returns only posts the user is `owner` of. Granting access:

```python
from rebac import backend, ObjectRef, SubjectRef, RelationshipTuple

backend().write_relationships([
    ("create", RelationshipTuple(
        resource=ObjectRef("blog/post", str(post.pk)),
        relation="owner",
        subject=SubjectRef.of("auth/user", str(user.pk)),
    )),
])
```

---

## Required headers

Every `.zed` file must declare three headers. They're parsed as comments by SpiceDB but consumed as metadata by `django-zed-rebac`:

| Header | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `// @rebac_package: <name>` | yes | Stable package identity. Used as `package` in `PackageManagedRecord` rows. |
| `// @rebac_package_version: <semver>` | yes | Track upgrades; informational. |
| `// @rebac_schema_revision: <int>` | yes | Bump on any schema change. Drives `noupdate=True` upgrade logic — admin edits to overrides are preserved unless the revision increments. |

The build refuses to run with missing headers (`rebac.E010`).

---

## Schema language quick reference

`.zed` files use SpiceDB's schema language. Three top-level forms:

```zed
// Definition — a resource or subject type.
definition blog/post {
    relation owner:  auth/user
    relation viewer: auth/user | auth/group#member

    permission read  = owner + viewer
    permission write = owner
}

// Caveat — a CEL expression evaluated against runtime context.
caveat ip_in_cidr(ip ipaddress, cidr string) {
    ip.in_cidr(cidr)
}

// Directive — a build-time switch (typechecking is auto-emitted).
use expiration
```

**Type identifiers** — `<namespace>/<name>` (e.g. `blog/post`, `auth/user`, `mcp/tool/edit`). Slashes are part of the identifier; no spaces.

**Relations** — typed edges from the definition to subject types. The right-hand side is a `|`-separated union:

```zed
relation viewer: auth/user                              // single type
relation viewer: auth/user | auth/group#member          // union with subject set
relation viewer: auth/user | auth/user:*                // union with wildcard
relation viewer: auth/user with ip_in_cidr              // with caveat
```

**Permissions** — computed expressions over relations:

```zed
permission read = owner                          // direct
permission read = owner + viewer                 // union
permission read = owner & published              // intersection
permission read = owner - banned                 // exclusion
permission read = owner + parent->read           // arrow (recurse)
```

**Operators**:

| Op | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `+` | union (binds tightest) |
| `&` | intersection |
| `-` | exclusion (binds loosest) |
| `->` | arrow — walk to the named relation, then check the named permission there |
| `:*` | wildcard — "any subject of this type" |
| `#<rel>` | subject set — "anyone with `<rel>` on this object" |

---

## Operator precedence — the one footgun

SpiceDB's expression precedence is **different from most languages**. `+` binds tightest, `&` next, `-` loosest. So `a + b & c` means `(a + b) & c`. **Always parenthesise** in compound expressions:

```zed
// ❌ Subtle. Means (owner + editor) & published.
permission read = owner + editor & published

// ✅ Explicit.
permission read = (owner + editor) & published
```

The build emits `use typechecking` automatically — that catches *type* errors (e.g. intersecting two mutually-exclusive subject types) but not *precedence* errors. Those are your responsibility.

---

## Patterns by scenario

### Users and groups

`django-zed-rebac` auto-emits `auth/user` and `auth/group` so they map onto `django.contrib.auth.User` and `Group`. You don't write these yourself:

```zed
// emitted by rebac itself
definition auth/user {}

definition auth/group {
    relation member: auth/user | auth/group#member
}
```

`auth/group#member` is a **subject set** — "anyone who is a `member` of this group". Use it to grant a relation to all group members at once:

```zed
// blog/permissions.zed
definition blog/post {
    relation owner:  auth/user
    relation viewer: auth/user | auth/group#member

    permission read  = owner + viewer
    permission write = owner
}
```

To grant `viewer` to every member of group `editors`:

```python
backend().write_relationships([
    ("create", RelationshipTuple(
        resource=ObjectRef("blog/post", str(post.pk)),
        relation="viewer",
        subject=SubjectRef(
            object=ObjectRef("auth/group", str(editors.pk)),
            optional_relation="member",
        ),
    )),
])
```

#### Auto-syncing Django's `User.groups`

Opt in with `REBAC_SYNC_DJANGO_GROUPS = True`. The plugin connects to the `User.groups` M2M change signal and writes `auth/group:<id>#member @ auth/user:<id>` rows. One-way (Django → REBAC); two-way is custom-territory.

#### Public read access

```zed
definition blog/page {
    relation editor:        auth/user
    relation public_viewer: auth/user | auth/user:*

    permission read  = editor + public_viewer
    permission write = editor
}
```

```python
# Make a page world-readable
backend().write_relationships([
    ("create", RelationshipTuple(
        resource=ObjectRef("blog/page", str(page.pk)),
        relation="public_viewer",
        subject=SubjectRef.of("auth/user", "*"),
    )),
])
```

**Wildcard rules:**

- Only on read-shaped permissions. The schema doctor (`rebac.W001`) emits a warning when a wildcard relation participates in a `write`/`delete`/`create` permission.
- Cannot be transitively included — `auth/user:*` cannot flow through a subject set like `auth/group#member`. SpiceDB rejects this at `WriteSchema` time.
- Cheap for `CheckPermission`; expensive for `LookupSubjects`. Prefer narrow shares when listing matters.

### Hierarchical resources (folders → files)

The classic recursive permission. `read` on a file = `read` on its parent folder.

```zed
// storage/permissions.zed
// @rebac_package: storage
// @rebac_package_version: 0.1.0
// @rebac_schema_revision: 1

definition storage/folder {
    relation owner:  auth/user
    relation viewer: auth/user | auth/group#member
    relation parent: storage/folder

    permission read  = owner + viewer + parent->read
    permission write = owner + parent->write
}

definition storage/file {
    relation owner:  auth/user
    relation folder: storage/folder

    permission read   = owner + folder->read
    permission write  = owner + folder->write
    permission delete = owner + folder->write
}
```

The arrow `parent->read` reads as "walk to the parent, then evaluate `read` over there". Recursion is bounded by `REBAC_DEPTH_LIMIT` (default 8). Deeper trees raise `PermissionDepthExceeded`; switch to `SpiceDBBackend` (default depth 50) when you need deep walks.

**Multi-hop arrows are not supported.** You cannot write `parent->parent->read`. The pattern above works because `read` itself recurses through `parent->read` — that's how multi-hop traversal is expressed in SpiceDB.

**Cycles in data.** SpiceDB doesn't reject `folder:A#parent @ folder:A`. The dispatcher hits the depth limit and silently returns `false`. Validate at the application layer:

```python
def assign_parent(self, new_parent):
    if self.is_descendant_of(new_parent):
        raise ValidationError("would create cycle")
    self.parent = new_parent
```

### Time-bound access

Modern SpiceDB schemas (v1.40+) support relationship expiration as a first-class feature. **Prefer this over the older "current_time as a caveat" pattern** — expiration garbage-collects automatically; caveats don't.

```zed
// blog/permissions.zed
use expiration

definition blog/post {
    relation owner:            auth/user
    relation temporary_viewer: auth/user with expiration

    permission read = owner + temporary_viewer
}
```

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

backend().write_relationships([
    ("create", RelationshipTuple(
        resource=ObjectRef("blog/post", str(post.pk)),
        relation="temporary_viewer",
        subject=SubjectRef.of("auth/user", str(user.pk)),
        expires_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(hours=24),
    )),
])
```

After 24 hours, `LocalBackend` excludes the row from query results; `rebac.gc.expire_relationships` deletes it within `REBAC_GC_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 300).

### Conditional access (caveats)

Caveats are CEL expressions evaluated against runtime context at check time. Use them for **dynamic** constraints — IP allow-lists, business hours, on-call membership. For static time bounds, prefer `use expiration`.

```zed
// docs/permissions.zed
caveat ip_in_cidr(ip ipaddress, cidr string) {
    ip.in_cidr(cidr)
}

caveat during_business_hours(hour int, start int, end int) {
    hour >= start && hour <= end
}

definition docs/sensitive {
    relation owner:                auth/user
    relation ip_restricted_viewer: auth/user with ip_in_cidr

    permission read = owner + ip_restricted_viewer
}
```

When writing the relationship, supply the static parameters (caveat *context*):

```python
backend().write_relationships([
    ("create", RelationshipTuple(
        resource=ObjectRef("docs/sensitive", str(doc.pk)),
        relation="ip_restricted_viewer",
        subject=SubjectRef.of("auth/user", str(user.pk)),
        caveat_name="ip_in_cidr",
        caveat_context={"cidr": "10.0.0.0/8"},
    )),
])
```

When checking, supply the runtime parameter:

```python
result = backend().check_access(
    subject=to_subject_ref(user),
    action="read",
    resource=ObjectRef("docs/sensitive", str(doc.pk)),
    context={"ip": request.META["REMOTE_ADDR"]},
)
# result == HAS_PERMISSION if user.ip is in 10.0.0.0/8
```

If you check WITHOUT supplying `ip`, the result is `CONDITIONAL_PERMISSION(missing=["ip"])`. The application can re-check with the missing field — useful for two-pass evaluation (cheap relationship check + expensive context resolution).

**`LocalBackend` caveat support.** Backed by [`cel-python`](https://pypi.org/project/cel-python/). Most CEL types work out of the box (`int`, `string`, `bool`, `list`, `map`, `timestamp`, `duration`). The `ipaddress` type is **not** in `cel-python`'s built-ins — `LocalBackend` raises `CaveatUnsupportedError`. Either migrate to `SpiceDBBackend`, or rewrite the caveat to take strings and do CIDR matching server-side.

### MCP tools as resources

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools are first-class resources. Permissions on them gate which tools an actor can invoke.

#### Pattern 1 — one resource type per tool

```zed
// mcp/permissions.zed
definition mcp/tool/query_posts {
    relation invoker: auth/user | agents/agent#operator
    permission invoke = invoker
}

definition mcp/tool/edit_post {
    relation invoker: auth/user        // narrower — no agent invocation
    permission invoke = invoker
}
```

Wire the tool with the plugin's MCP decorator:

```python
from rebac.mcp import rebac_mcp_tool

@mcp.tool
@rebac_mcp_tool(resource_type="mcp/tool/query_posts", action="invoke")
async def query_posts(query: str, ctx: Context = CurrentContext()) -> list[dict]:
    ...
```

Granting the right to invoke:

```python
backend().write_relationships([
    ("create", RelationshipTuple(
        resource=ObjectRef("mcp/tool/query_posts", "*"),  # "*" = the tool itself
        relation="invoker",
        subject=SubjectRef.of("auth/user", str(user.pk)),
    )),
])
```

#### Pattern 2 — group tools into capability categories

For larger projects, one resource type per tool gets unwieldy. Group them:

```zed
definition mcp/capability {
    relation granted_to: auth/user | agents/agent#operator
    permission use = granted_to
}
```

Tag each tool with the capability it requires:

```python
@mcp.tool
@rebac_mcp_tool(resource_type="mcp/capability", action="use", id_arg="_capability")
async def query_posts(
    query: str,
    ctx: Context = CurrentContext(),
    *,
    _capability: str = "blog.read",
) -> list[dict]:
    ...
```

The `_capability="blog.read"` argument is filtered out of the published MCP schema (clients don't see it) but tells the decorator which capability to check. Capabilities form a flat namespace (`blog.read`, `blog.write`, `admin.users`) — easy for admins to grant in bulk.

### Agents acting on behalf of users (the Grant pattern)

The canonical Authzed-recommended pattern for AI agents. An agent's effective permission on any resource is automatically the **structural intersection** of (a) the user's grants on that resource and (b) the agent's declared capabilities — enforced by the schema graph, not by app-layer ANDs.

#### Definitions live in YOUR `agents` app, not in the plugin

`agents/agent` and `agents/grant` are **not** auto-emitted. They live in a separate `agents` app you ship (or in a downstream framework that supplies them). The plugin only emits `auth/user` and `auth/group`.

A typical `agents/permissions.zed`:

```zed
// agents/permissions.zed — in YOUR agents app, not in rebac
// @rebac_package: agents
// @rebac_package_version: 0.1.0
// @rebac_schema_revision: 1

definition agents/agent {
    relation operator:       auth/user
    relation has_capability: agents/capability
}

definition agents/capability {}        // marker type

definition agents/grant {
    relation user:  auth/user
    relation agent: agents/agent

    permission active = user & agent
}
```

A `Grant` row encodes "user U has delegated to agent A". Both relations must be present for `active` to resolve true.

#### Targeting resources from grants

Add `agents/grant#active` to the type union of any relation that should accept agent invocation:

```zed
// blog/permissions.zed
definition blog/post {
    relation owner:  auth/user
    relation viewer: auth/user | auth/group#member | agents/grant#active

    permission read  = owner + viewer
    permission write = owner                         // agents can't write
}
```

The clever bit: when the subject is `agents/grant:G123`, SpiceDB's evaluator walks the grant's `user` relation, recursively asks "is *that user* a viewer/owner?", and only returns `true` if so. The agent **inherits** the user's view but can never exceed it.

#### Bounding the agent further by capability

To restrict a specific agent to a subset of actions even when the user can do more:

```zed
definition blog/post_capability {
    relation read_capability:  agents/capability
    relation write_capability: agents/capability
}

definition blog/post {
    relation owner:  auth/user
    relation viewer: auth/user | agents/grant#active

    permission read  = owner + (viewer & blog/post_capability:_self->read_capability)
    permission write = owner & blog/post_capability:_self->write_capability
}
```

The `agent->has_capability` walk inside the permission expression intersects the user's grant with the agent's declared capabilities.

#### Per-grant exceptions via caveats

Sometimes a grant should be valid only in a window, an IP range, or for specific model kinds:

```zed
caveat grant_constraints(now timestamp, expires_at timestamp, model_kind string, allowed_kinds list<string>) {
    now < expires_at && model_kind in allowed_kinds
}
```

```python
backend().write_relationships([
    ("create", RelationshipTuple(
        resource=ObjectRef("agents/grant", str(grant.pk)),
        relation="user",
        subject=SubjectRef.of("auth/user", str(user.pk)),
        caveat_name="grant_constraints",
        caveat_context={
            "expires_at": "2026-12-31T23:59:59Z",
            "allowed_kinds": ["claude_internal", "claude_external"],
        },
    )),
])
```

When the agent invokes a tool, the request passes `now` and `model_kind` as runtime context — `active` only resolves if both context-side checks pass.

#### Querying as an agent

`with_actor(actor)` is the generic verb; `as_agent(agent, on_behalf_of=user)` is the typed shorthand:

```python
# Common case: HTTP request from a Django user
Post.objects.as_user(request.user)
# expands to: Post.objects.with_actor(to_subject_ref(request.user))
#                       → SubjectRef(auth/user:<id>)

# Agent acting on behalf of a user (canonical Grant pattern)
Post.objects.as_agent(agent, on_behalf_of=request.user)
# expands to: Post.objects.with_actor(grant_subject_ref(agent, request.user))
#                       → SubjectRef(agents/grant:<grant_id>#active)

# Or pass any SubjectRef directly:
Post.objects.with_actor(SubjectRef.of("agents/grant", str(grant.pk)))
Post.objects.with_actor(SubjectRef.of("auth/apikey", apikey.public_id))

# Anything @rebac_subject-decorated also resolves automatically:
Post.objects.with_actor(my_apikey_instance)
```

Inside an MCP tool, where the canonical actor is an `agents/grant`:

```python
@mcp.tool
@rebac_mcp_tool(resource_type="blog/post", action="write", id_arg="post_id")
async def edit_post(post_id: str, body: str, ctx: Context = CurrentContext()) -> dict:
    user, agent = ctx.rebac.user, ctx.rebac.agent
    post = await Post.objects.as_agent(agent, on_behalf_of=user).aget(pk=post_id)
    post.body = body
    await post.asave()                  # re-checks `write` against the same grant
    return {"ok": True}
```

`with_actor` does NOT mutate `current_actor()` — the originating actor (typically the request user) is preserved for audit. See [ARCHITECTURE.md § `with_actor` vs `sudo`](./ARCHITECTURE.md#with_actor-vs-sudo--distinct-verbs).

### Celery tasks acting on behalf of users

Tasks inherit the actor automatically when wired through the plugin's signals (see [ARCHITECTURE.md § Celery](./ARCHITECTURE.md#celery)). The schema authoring is the same as for HTTP — you don't declare separate "task" resource types unless tasks themselves are gated.

If they are (e.g., "only ops users can run reindex"), declare them as resources:

```zed
// ops/permissions.zed
definition celery/task/reindex_posts {
    relation runner: auth/user
    permission invoke = runner
}
```

```python
from rebac import require_permission

@shared_task
@require_permission(
    action="invoke",
    resource_type="celery/task/reindex_posts",
    resource_id="*",
)
def reindex_posts():
    ...
```

### DRF viewsets

DRF integration requires NO additional schema authoring. The model's `rebac_resource_type` is the source of truth; `RebacPermission` and `RebacFilterBackend` consult the schema:

```python
from rebac.drf import RebacPermission, RebacFilterBackend

class PostViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset           = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class   = PostSerializer
    permission_classes = [RebacPermission]
    filter_backends    = [RebacFilterBackend]
```

Default action map: `list`/`retrieve` → `read`, `create` → `create`, `update`/`partial_update` → `write`, `destroy` → `delete`. Customise by subclassing:

```python
class PublishablePerm(RebacPermission):
    action_map = {**RebacPermission.action_map, "publish": "publish"}

class PostViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    permission_classes = [PublishablePerm]

    @action(detail=True, methods=["post"])
    @require_permission("publish")
    def publish(self, request, pk):
        ...
```

### Plain Python entities (non-ORM)

Anything with a stable string ID can be a resource. Declare the type in any app's `permissions.zed`, then register the Python class with `@rebac_resource`:

```zed
// storage/permissions.zed (excerpt)
definition storage/s3_prefix {
    relation reader: auth/user
    permission read = reader
}
```

```python
from rebac import rebac_resource, backend, to_object_ref, to_subject_ref

@rebac_resource(type="storage/s3_prefix", id_attr="prefix")
class S3Prefix:
    def __init__(self, prefix: str):
        self.prefix = prefix


prefix = S3Prefix("uploads/2026/")
result = backend().check_access(
    subject=to_subject_ref(user),
    action="read",
    resource=to_object_ref(prefix),     # uses id_attr=prefix
)
```

This makes REBAC available for any resource boundary your project has, not just Django ORM rows.

### Multi-tenant scoping (soft tenants)

For projects where one Django DB serves multiple tenants, set `REBAC_TYPE_PREFIX` per request:

```python
REBAC_TYPE_PREFIX = "tenant_acme/"
```

Every resource type emitted becomes `tenant_acme/blog/post`. Relationships from one tenant cannot be referenced by another.

For hard-tenant isolation (separate databases or schemas), use `django-tenants` and let each tenant own its own `Relationship` table — no schema changes needed.

---

## Composing schemas across packages

The build walks every installed app, parses each app's `rebac_schema` file, and composes them into a single `effective.zed`. Sort is alphabetical by resource type — deterministic across runs.

**Cross-app references are first-class.** A `blog/post` definition in one app can name `storage/folder` from another:

```zed
// blog/permissions.zed
definition blog/post {
    relation folder: storage/folder         // declared in storage/permissions.zed
    relation owner:  auth/user
    permission read = owner + folder->read
}
```

The build raises a clear error if `storage/folder` isn't defined anywhere. **Cycles between apps are rejected** at build time — the dependency DAG enforces ordering (`blog` depends on `storage`; `storage` depending back on `blog` is a build error).

---

## Anti-patterns to avoid

### 1. Don't put `auth/user:*` in write-shaped permissions

```zed
// ❌ Anyone can edit anything.
definition blog/post {
    relation editor: auth/user | auth/user:*
    permission write = editor
}
```

The schema doctor (`rebac.W001`) warns when a wildcard relation participates in a `write`/`delete`/`create` permission. Wildcards are for read-shaped, public-share patterns only.

### 2. Don't smuggle wildcards transitively

```zed
// ❌ SpiceDB rejects this at WriteSchema time.
relation viewer: auth/user:* | auth/group#member
```

Error: "wildcard relations cannot be transitively included." Wildcards cannot flow through subject sets.

### 3. Don't write circular `parent` relations in your data

The schema is fine; the data corrupts the graph:

```
folder:A#parent @ folder:B
folder:B#parent @ folder:A   // ← cycle
```

SpiceDB hits the depth limit and silently returns `false`. Validate at the application layer (see [§ Hierarchical resources](#hierarchical-resources-folders--files)).

### 4. Don't intersect mutually-exclusive subject types

```zed
// ❌ user is type auth/user; admin is type billing/admin.
// This permission is never satisfiable.
permission edit = user & admin
```

The auto-emitted `use typechecking` directive catches this at `WriteSchema` time. The plugin runs the same typecheck locally and refuses to emit the schema.

### 5. Don't forget operator parens

```zed
// ❌ Means (a + b) & c. Probably not what you wanted.
permission read = a + b & c

// ✅
permission read = a + (b & c)
```

See [§ Operator precedence](#operator-precedence--the-one-footgun) above.

### 6. Don't model agents as principals — use the Grant pattern

```zed
// ❌ Bypasses the user's grants entirely.
definition blog/post {
    relation agent_viewer: agents/agent
    permission read = owner + agent_viewer
}
```

The Grant pattern (`agents/grant#active`) is canonical because the agent's permission flows through the user's grants — they can never exceed the user. Modeling agents as direct principals is a security smell.

### 7. Don't omit the required headers

The build refuses (`rebac.E010`) if any of `// @rebac_package`, `// @rebac_package_version`, `// @rebac_schema_revision` is missing. Bump the revision number whenever you change the schema, even for cosmetic changes — the upgrade-safety machinery uses it to decide whether admin overrides survive.

## Patterns library — copyable starting points

### Pattern A — RBAC (role-based access control)

```zed
definition docs/document {
    relation admin:  auth/user
    relation writer: auth/user
    relation reader: auth/user | auth/group#member

    permission read   = admin + writer + reader
    permission write  = admin + writer
    permission delete = admin
}
```

### Pattern B — Hierarchical resources

```zed
definition docs/folder {
    relation owner:  auth/user
    relation parent: docs/folder

    permission read  = owner + parent->read
    permission write = owner + parent->write
}

definition docs/document {
    relation owner:  auth/user
    relation folder: docs/folder

    permission read  = owner + folder->read
    permission write = owner + folder->write
}
```

### Pattern C — Ownership + group sharing

```zed
definition blog/post {
    relation owner:        auth/user
    relation group_member: auth/group#member

    permission read  = owner + group_member
    permission write = owner
}
```

### Pattern D — Public-readable, group-writable

```zed
definition blog/page {
    relation editor:        auth/user
    relation public_viewer: auth/user | auth/user:*

    permission read  = editor + public_viewer
    permission write = editor
}
```

### Pattern E — Time-bound shared access (expiration)

```zed
use expiration

definition docs/document {
    relation owner:            auth/user
    relation temporary_viewer: auth/user with expiration

    permission read = owner + temporary_viewer
}
```

### Pattern F — Conditional access (caveat)

```zed
caveat tenant_match(user_tenant string, doc_tenant string) {
    user_tenant == doc_tenant
}

definition docs/document {
    relation viewer: auth/user with tenant_match
    permission read = viewer
}
```

### Pattern G — Agent acting on behalf of user (Grant pattern)

```zed
definition docs/document {
    relation owner:  auth/user
    relation viewer: auth/user | auth/group#member | agents/grant#active

    permission read  = owner + viewer
    permission write = owner                       // agents can read but not write
}
```

### Pattern H — MCP tool gated by capability

```zed
definition mcp/capability {
    relation granted_to: auth/user | agents/agent#operator
    permission use = granted_to
}
```

```python
@mcp.tool
@rebac_mcp_tool(resource_type="mcp/capability", action="use", id_arg="_capability")
async def search_documents(
    q: str,
    ctx: Context = CurrentContext(),
    *,
    _capability: str = "docs.search",
):
    ...
```

### Pattern I — Celery task gated by role

```zed
definition celery/task/reindex {
    relation runner: auth/user
    permission invoke = runner
}
```

```python
@shared_task
@require_permission(action="invoke", resource_type="celery/task/reindex", resource_id="*")
def reindex():
    ...
```

### Pattern J — Public Python entity (S3 prefix)

```zed
definition storage/s3_prefix {
    relation reader: auth/user | auth/user:*
    permission read = reader
}
```

```python
@rebac_resource(type="storage/s3_prefix", id_attr="prefix")
class S3Prefix:
    def __init__(self, prefix: str):
        self.prefix = prefix
```

## Reference — supported subset of the SpiceDB schema language

The plugin parses the SpiceDB-canonical subset relevant to Django projects:

- `definition` blocks (top-level)
- `relation` declarations with type unions, subject sets, wildcards, `with <caveat>`, `with expiration`
- `permission` expressions: `+`, `&`, `-`, arrows (`->`)
- `caveat` blocks with parameters and CEL expressions
- Directives: `use typechecking` (auto-emitted), `use expiration`

NOT yet supported by the parser (raw `.zed` import + `WriteSchema` only when running against SpiceDB):

- `use import` / composable schemas — multi-package composition is handled by the plugin's app-walking build instead
- `use self` shortcut — niche; raise an issue if needed
- `nil` type — almost never useful

For the full upstream language, see the [authzed schema reference](https://authzed.com/docs/spicedb/concepts/schema).
