"""Pickle posture for ``RebacMixin`` (Part J of the C+J work plan).

Per ``CLAUDE.md § 5``, instances may cross HTTP→Celery via
``apply_async(args=[instance])``. The actor's persistence across that
boundary is documented; the *sudo* bypass posture is NOT documented and
must fail closed. ``__getstate__`` strips ``_rebac_actor``,
``_rebac_sudo_reason``, and ``_rebac_loaded_values`` so a pickled
instance cannot smuggle a trusted actor across a process boundary.
